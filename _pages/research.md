		Mingzhe's research interests involve a series of different subsystems and topics of computer architectures, such as cache, NoC, NVM, performance and security. With the passion in research, Mingzhe strongly believes that the fundamental problems behind the various emerging concepts are consistent and interlinked. Focusing on these problems is the only way to avoid lost in the increasing emerging new concepts and topics, while makes continuous contributions to the rapid changing world.

## Projects

Here are some examples of our research projects:<br>

	<h3>Exploring Dynamic Trade-offs in Emerging Resistive Memory Technologies:</h3><br>
	<img src="https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/images/drift.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="left">
	<span>
			This project focuses on designing the optimization schemes based on the dynamic trade-offs lies in the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) materials. The optimization targets include system performance, energy consumption and component lifetime. Differentiate from the previous work, our proposed schemes utilize the results of application analysis and find the "interface" for the characteristics from the different levels. This project is collaborated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lunkai-zhang/">Dr. Lunkai Zhang (Western Digital)</a>, <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/">Prof. Frederic T. Chong (UChicago)</a> and <a href="https://jiang60.pages.iu.edu/">Prof. Lei Jiang (IUB)</a>. Partially funded by CSC (No. 201504910535), NSFC (No. 62002339) and the Key Research Program of State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture (No. CARCH4506).

	<h3>Optimization for Machine Learning Accelerators based on Data Sparsity:</h3><br>
	<img src="https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/images/bitlet.png" width="300" height="220" align="left">
	<span>
			This project focuses on improving the performance and energy-efficiency for the machine learning accelerators. The proposed schemes are based on data-level or bit-level sparsity and reduce the unnecessary operations. This project is collaborated with <a href="https://luhang-ccl.github.io/">Prof. Hang Lu (ICT, CAS)</a> and <a href="https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/changliang/en/index/366304/list/index.htm">Prof. Liang Chang (UESTC)</a>. Partially funded by NSFC (No. 62172387, 62002339 and 62104025), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDB44030200), the NSAF (No. U2030204) and the Key Research Program of State Key Labora- tory of Computer Architecture (No. CARCH5301 and CARCH4506).

	<h3>Secure Computation for Data-Intensive Applications:</h3><br>
	<img src="https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/images/string-oram.png" width="300" height="150" align="left">
	<span>
			This project focuses on providing secure environment for the data-intensive applications and systems. The most important task of this project is to avoid the information leakage caused by the attack to the memory, while minimizing the impact on the performance. This project is collaborated with <a href="https://rujiawang.github.io/">Prof. Rujia Wang (IIT)</a>. Partially funded by NSFC (No. 62002339) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDB44030200).
