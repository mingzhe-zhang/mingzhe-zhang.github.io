		Mingzhe's research interests involve a series of different subsystems and topics of computer architectures, such as cache, NoC, NVM, performance and security. With the passion in research, Mingzhe strongly believes that the fundamental problems behind the various emerging concepts are consistent and interlinked. Focusing on these problems is the only way to avoid lost in the increasing emerging new concepts and topics, while makes continuous contributions to the rapid changing world.

## Projects

On-going project:<br>

<div>
	<h3>Architectural Support for Fully Homomorphic Encryption Computation</h3>
	<img src="../images/FHE-concept.jpg" width="300" align="left">
	<span>
		The Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is considered as one of the most competitive privacy protection technique for cloud computing, which allows directly computation on the encryted data. However, its over-high performance overhead limits the wide application of FHE. This project focuses on providing the acceleration support for FHE with the architectural efforts, which include but not limited to commercal devices (e.g., GPGPU, FPGA), domain-specific ASIC accelerators and other emerging techniques.

	<h3>Exploring Dynamic Trade-offs in Emerging Resistive Memory Technologies:</h3>
	<img src="https://mingzhe-zhang.github.io/images/drift.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="left">
	<span>
			This project focuses on designing the optimization schemes based on the dynamic trade-offs lies in the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) materials. The optimization targets include system performance, energy consumption and component lifetime. Differentiate from the previous work, our proposed schemes utilize the results of application analysis and find the "interface" for the characteristics from the different levels.
