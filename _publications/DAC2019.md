## Abstract
3D vertical ReRAM (3DV-ReRAM) emerges as one of the most promising alternatives to DRAM due to its good scalability beyond 10nm. Monolithic 3D (M3D) integration enables 3DV-ReRAM to improve its array area efficiency by stacking peripheral circuits underneath an array. A 3DV-ReRAM array has to be large enough to fully cover the peripheral circuits, but such large array size significantly increases its access latency. In this paper, we propose Magma, a M3D stacked heterogeneous ReRAM array architecture, for future main memory systems by stacking a large unipolar 3DV-ReRAM array on the top of a small bipolar 3DV-ReRAM array and peripheral circuits shared by two arrays. We further architect the small bipolar array as a direct-mapped cache for the main memory system. Compared to homogeneous ReRAMs, on average, Magma improves the system performance by 11.4%, reduces the system energy by 24.3% and obtains > 5-year lifetime.
