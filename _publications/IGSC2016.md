## Abstract
As the communication sub-system that connecting various on-chip components, Network-on-Chip (NoC) has a great influence on the performance of multi-/many-core processors. Because of NoC model contains a large number of parameters, the design space exploration (DSE) for NoC is a critical problem for the architects. Similar to the core design, existing DSE process mainly depends on iteratively time-consuming simulations. To lower the time budget, many previous studies focus on reducing the simulations. However, most of the proposed works based on regression or machine learning techniques, whose accuracy will be significantly affected by the scale of training set. It still needs a lot of simulations to build the training set.
